# CPB_Project
## Motivation
The Management of ABC Inc. desired to leverage customers' economic choices and social characteristics data
to understand their purchasing patterns and use insights gained from the process to enhance the company's product sales, hence impacting positively their annual bottom line.

## Project Overview
In the project, four business questions and an hypothesis - 'All customers purchase equally vs All customers do not purchase equally' were interrogated, by the analysis of a relevant subset (1,966 records x 11 features) of the dataset sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data], and adopting a 2-level data analysis approach. Machine learning classification models were constructed and consequent exploratory data analyses performed, to generate insights used to provide marketing strategy recommendations to the management team, towards achieving the goal of increased yearly profit for the company.   

## Data Analytics Process
The 2-level data analysis procedure consists of:
1.	Level 1 – Segmentation modeling of the Customer’s purchasing behaviour using the – 
    a.	Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) analytical framework
    b.	K-Mean Nearest Neighbour classification modeling, and
    c.	Hierarchical classification modeling  
2.	Level 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of each of the identified Customer’s segment

## Result
### Findings & Interpretations
1.    Four clusters of customers with similar RFM characteristics were revealed.
2.    Further analyses and interpretation of the customer clusters identified:
      a. Cluster 2 as 'Premium' customer segment
      b. Clusters 1 & 3 as 'Opportunity' customer segments
      c. Cluster 4 as 'Least Contributor' customer segment   
### Insights
The following were subsequently inferred from the analyses. Within the premium segment, youth (between 26 and 32 years) and female customers spent most on purchases from the client company both in absolute (total) and mean values also difference in education level was significant in this segment. For the ‘Opportunity’ customer segments, the difference in annual income was significant, there were more of recent purchases by customers and many more female customers (76.5% on average) participated in both of the client company’s promotional events of months 1-7,  and months 8-13-than their male counterpart (23.5% on average). In the ‘Least Contributor’ customer segment the gap between the annual incomes of this group of customers was not significant and much more (80.2%) females were not purchasing items from the client’s company compared to their male counterpart (19.8%).

## Recommendations
The prime recommendation for the ‘Premium’ customer segment was for the company to always stock luxurious and expensive women items since they are frequent customers and also heavy spenders. For the ‘Opportunity’ customer segment, the top recommendation was that educational level should the taken into consideration when marketing campaigns targeted at this group is being designed. For the ‘Least Contributor’ customer class, the client company was advised not to spend resources on retaining them, but rather let them naturally self-upgrade to higher class or self-dropout.

The dataset analyzed for the project was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data]. It consisted of data for 1?? customers that
measured features on the purchasing behaviours of ABC Inc. and their social attributes.
