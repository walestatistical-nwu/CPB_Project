# CPB_Project
## Motivation
The Management of ABC Inc. desired to leverage the customers' economic choices and social characteristics data
to understand their purchasing patterns and use the insights gained from the process to enhance sales of products, thereby impacting their bottom line.


## Project Overview
The dataset analyzed for the project was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data]. 
A most relevant subset of the dataset was sliced and analysed using an analytical framework that segmented customers into groups. An exploratory data analysis was
done on a group basis to generate insights that inform recommendations for the management team to support their planning and decision-making functions.   

It consisted of data for 1?? customers that
measured features on the purchasing behaviours of ABC Inc. and their social attributes.
